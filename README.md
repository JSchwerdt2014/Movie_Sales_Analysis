# **Movie-Correlation-Poject**

In this project we have a up and coming movie producer wanting to make some data-driven decisions about the production of the film.
We will use correlation data to provide profitable insights.

1. What factors have the greatest influence on gross sales?
2. Within those factors, is there a set range that performs best?

## **Methods Used**

-Data Analysis  
-Data Visualization  
-Predictive Modeling  

## **Technologies**

-Python  
-Jupyter Notebooks  
-Pandas  
-MatPlotLib  
-Seaborn  
-NumPy  
-Tableau 

## **Project Discription**

This project is a data analysis of movie sales data. We use a kagle dataset and clean the dataset using python pandas. We then explore the data using correlation data to see what factors have the highest correlation with gross sales. We find that budget and movie run time are the highest controllable correlations and explore the correlationn between each of them and gross sales.
